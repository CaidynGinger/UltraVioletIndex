### Project Description

This webpage is a application which I built to learn how to use Google analytics and google search console for my
interactive development degree at open window it features a home page where you can read more about the webpage a section on the project and another section about me
<br>
<br>
Going into what the webpage does it is able to find the current uv ray radiation - the cause of sunburn of your current location and additionally you can find the uv rays of cities via a live search
<br>
<br>
There is also a feedback page where you can email me personally :grinning:

### Built With

- [Javascritp](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Mapbox Geocoding](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/)
- [OpenUV](https://www.openuv.io/uvindex)

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- Utilized jQuerry for the Ui animations
- Utilized Bootstrap for the responsiveness of the website
- API End Point: <a href='https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/'>OpenUV</a>
- API End Point: <a href='https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/'>Mapbox Geocoding</a>

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- it was enjoyable to go back to old school JS and html for this project
- working with google analytics was enjoyable too and to see how my website is doing on a live environment
- additionally I learnt a valuable lesson that sure bootstrap is just css and I can make it all by my self however as a developer I shouldn't be waisting my time with
  css as almost everything has been done I should code new and exciting functions rather than wist time on css
  - therefore I have now embraces bootstrap into my coding ecosystem and I am no longer biased to bootstrap

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- The main challenge was to do a reverse geolocation from city name to latitude and longitude as my api requests required it to solve this I had to utilize another api 
  <a href='https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/'>OpenUV</a>
  <a href='https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/'>Mapbox Geocoding</a> finding this api was quite difficult as others required specific keys and other set ups
  and additionally payment this one was free to use so it was a big win.
- after I had received the lat and long I then needed to process this into a url link that would be passed to the <a href='https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/'>OpenUV</a>
and then receive the data and update it on the UV report

- also I applied for an https citeificat however one of my apis is a http request and there for cantot be called under a https this was dissapinting as i had to revert back 
- to a http and loose the https citificate
##### Bugs

- Emailer not working.
  - as for right now the emailer is not working and needs to be fixed this was my first time using php and it was a
    kitbash job of copy and paste a very poor way to implement new technology
  - to over come this issue ive purchased a php course on Udemy which I will work through in the month of April
- Feedback form streamlining.
  - the feed back form could use some work for the above issue and as well as user interactivity the place holder
    text is not removed onclick and needs to be revisited
- responsiveness the uv report tool could use better responsively as the mobile view is quite poor

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?

<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->

- going above and beyond for this project was in some ways not about the code but rather how we would host the website and analyze the data, so in light of this.
  - on the coding side its all about readability and making sure file structures make sense so that developers can read the file and code structures clearly
  - firstly the url I originally picked was very poor as it was -uvsunwathcer.co.za- this url didn't make sense to the application and so I switched it to -ultravioletindex.co.za-
    this was a better choice as my site saw a natural improvement
  - hosting started to become an issue as I noticed that majority of my traffic was coming from the USA and I needed to make a dissension if I was going to re-host however
    hosting option in the USA are more expensive and I felt the investment was not going to bea worth it.

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- To be able to see your location on an interactive map.
- A user login and a uv viewer where login users can save cities and keep track of a list of cities
- and always clean up css issues and maybe consider moving to scss
- be able to print out the uv report as a pdf would also be a nice addition
